purescript-fantasy
==================

This is supposed to provide interop between the PureScript language and the fantasyland spec.

The fantasyland spec assumes that the operations are going to be defined on the data types.
PureScript uses functions in typeclasses.
So we just need to take the data type generated by PureScript and inject the fantasyland spec into its prototype using the typeclasses from PureScript.

Unfortunately, at the moment, PureScript generates plain objects for each data type.
Once each data type has its own prototype we can implement this pretty easily.

```purescript
module Foo where

  import Data.Monoid
  import Fantasize
  
  data Foo a = Foo | Bar a
  
  instance semigroupFoo :: Semigroup (Foo a) where
    ...
  
  instance monoidFoo :: Monoid (Foo a) where
    ...
  
  instance functorFoo :: Functor Foo where
    ...
  
  main = do
    fantasyFunctor Foo
    fantasySemigroup Foo
    fantasyMonoid Foo
```

Or something...
